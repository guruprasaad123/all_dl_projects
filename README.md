- to check the backend for the api please refer [here](sign_dataset/backend)

- to check the frontend for the application please refer [here](sign_dataset/frontend)

## [Chest Xray Classification Challenge](chest_xray_challenge)

Got `100 %` Accuracy on validation set , `90 %` Accuracy on testing set

- to check the model architecture , training , code and for more details  please refer [here](chest_xray_challenge)

## [Holiday Challenge - Hackerearth](holiday_challenge)

Got > 60 % accuracy for this hackerearth [challenge](https://www.hackerearth.com/problem/machine-learning/holiday-season-11-2c924626)

- Tried these architectures

    - Resnet - 18 , 34 , 50 , 101
    - Inception - v1 , v3

- to check the model architecture , training , code and for more details  please refer [here](holiday_challenge)

## [German Traffic Sign Recognition Dataset (GTSRB)](GTSRB)

- Trained the model from scratch on VGG-SE ( SE - squeeze and excitation ) , modified version of VGG net and got *> 90 %*

- Gained Insights about how adding squeeze and excitation could have impact on accuracy , loss

- to check the model architecture , training , code and for more details  please refer [here](GTSRB)

## [Face Similarity](face_match)

- Trained the model to learn the face similarity mapping using siemese networks

- So , that the model can detect the similarity between the same person , dis-similarity between the different person

- to check the model architecture , training , code and for more details  please refer [here](face_match)

## [Poem Generator](poem_generator)

- Train the GRU/LSTM model to learn the poems

- the model can generate the poems , if we provide the trigger word/sentence

- to check the model architecture , experimentations , code and for more details please refer [here](poem_generator)

## [Covid Twitter Analysis App](covid_twitter_app)

Application that uses twitter api to fetch the tweets having the hashtag covid-19 , does sentiment analysis , measure the polarity , categorizes labels for the tweets

- to check the model architecture , experimentations , code and for more details  please refer [here](covid_twitter_app/model)

- to check the backend for the api please refer [here](covid_twitter_app/backend)

- to check the frontend for the application please refer [here](covid_twitter_app/frontend)


## [Question Answering App](q_and_a)

Application retrieves the answer to your question , if there is semantic similarity between the input and existing question
